object = {
	'filename': "the filename tree of this image",
	'width': "640width",
	'height': "480height",
	'gaze_cx': "This is the specific point gx in the image that is considered the gazepoint",

	'ann': {
		'hbox': "Bounding box of the head of the person in the image. In [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] format."
	},
	'seg_mask': 'the ground truth segmentation mask tree of the gazed at product area'
}


NOTE: gaze_cx, gaze_yx, hbox all are in the scale of 640x480.
